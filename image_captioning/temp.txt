You are passing both `text` and `images` to `PaliGemmaProcessor`. The processor expects special image tokens in the text, as many tokens as there are images per each text. It is recommended to add `<image>` tokens in the very beginning of your text. For this call, we will infer how many images each text has and add special tokens.
