1. Detailed Building Description
	1.	Overall Shape and Size
	•	A compact wall segment measuring 7 blocks wide (x), 4 blocks tall (y), and 2 blocks deep (z).
	•	The top has a “battlement” or parapet design with alternating raised and lowered sections.
	•	The middle section is a solid wall approximately 2 blocks tall.
	•	The bottom foundation row protrudes slightly, giving the wall a sturdier base.
	2.	Materials
	•	stone_bricks (the only visible block from your list)
	3.	Approximate Block Count
	•	~50–55 stone_bricks total (depending on how many cutouts you include in the parapet).
	4.	Height & Proportions
	•	The structure is about twice the height of a Minecraft character (who stands 2 blocks tall).
	•	The parapet at the top extends 1 block above the main wall body and contains crenellations (the “teeth” of a castle wall).

2. Structured Reconstruction Information

Below are three logical steps (or components) to build the wall from the ground up.

⸻

Component 1: Stone Bricks Foundation

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Sturdy Stone Bricks Base
	•	Material:
	    •	stone_bricks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	~14 stone_bricks (one layer, 7 wide × 2 deep)
	•	Dimension:
	    •	7 blocks along x, 1 block along y (height), 2 blocks along z
	    •	Extends from y = 0 (ground) up to y = 1
	•	Position:
	    •	Center the build on (0,0,0) so that x ranges from -3 to +3, and z from 0 to +1 (for instance).
	    •	The top of this foundation finishes at y = 1.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	You can make this base a fully solid 7×2 layer to provide a sturdy look.
	    2.	If you prefer a flush front face, you can shift the second row so that only 1 block protrudes in front.
	•	Description:
	    •	This single-layer stone_bricks platform acts as a thick footing for the wall, adding a defensive look.

Component 2: Main Wall Body

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Main Rectangular Wall
	•	Material:
	    •	stone_bricks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	~28 stone_bricks (7 wide × 2 tall × 2 deep)
	•	Dimension:
	    •	7 blocks along x, 2 blocks tall (y = 1 to y = 3), 2 blocks along z
	•	Position:
	    •	Place directly on top of the foundation, spanning from y = 1 to y = 3.
	    •	Match the same 7×2 footprint in the x–z plane.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Build two full rows (each 7 wide × 2 deep) so that the wall is 2 blocks thick.
	    2.	Ensure a smooth front face and leave the rear side for a possible walkway if desired.
	•	Description:
	    •	The primary defensive face of the structure, forming a solid wall about 2 blocks tall above the foundation.

Component 3: Parapet (Battlements)

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Upper Crenellations
	•	Material:
	    •	stone_bricks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	~10–15 stone_bricks (depending on your pattern)
	•	Dimension:
	    •	7 blocks along x, 1 block tall (y = 3 to y = 4), 2 blocks along z
	•	Position:
	    •	Placed on top of the main wall, from y = 3 to y = 4.
	    •	Align with the same 7×2 footprint.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	To create crenellations, place a row of stone_bricks along the front edge and the back edge, then remove every other block (or whichever pattern you like).
	    2.	Maintain consistent gaps to emulate a classic castle battlement design.
	    3.	If you want a walkway behind the battlements, leave the row fully in place on the back edge.
	•	Description:
	    •	This top section provides the iconic “castle” look, with raised blocks (merlons) and open spaces (crenels) for archers or decoration.

Final Notes and Assembly
	1.	Build the Foundation (Component 1) at ground level.
	2.	Stack the Main Wall Body (Component 2) on top of it, extending to y = 3.
	3.	Add the Parapet (Component 3) at the top layer, giving the wall a total height of 4 blocks (y = 4 at the tallest points).

Once completed, you have a small fortress wall segment—perfect for ramparts or the outer edge of a castle. You can replicate or tile this design around a perimeter to form a complete defensive wall.
