1. Detailed Building Description
	1.	Overall Shape and Size
	•	A classical, rectangular “temple” structure with quartz_block columns and walls.
	•	A low-pitched roof made of red_sandstone slabs (stepped in full blocks here for simplicity).
	•	Dimensions: approximately 9 blocks wide (x), 7 blocks deep (z), and 6 blocks tall (y) from the ground to the apex of the roof.
	2.	Foundation / Base
	•	A raised quartz_block platform (1 block tall) that extends slightly beyond the walls on all sides.
	•	A small step or two at the front entrance.
	3.	Columns and Walls
	•	The front façade features four evenly spaced columns of quartz_block, each 3 blocks tall, supporting a horizontal entablature (lintel) at the top.
	•	Behind the columns are walls enclosing a simple interior space (about 7×5 on the inside).
	4.	Roof
	•	Made of red_sandstone blocks, with a stepped slope from left to right (or front to back), creating a shallow gable.
	•	Overhangs by 1 block on each side for a classic temple look.
	5.	Approximate Block Counts
	•	Quartz_block: ~120 total (foundation, columns, walls, and horizontal beams)
	•	Red_sandstone: ~40 total (roof)

(Exact counts may vary depending on interior details or any decorative steps at the entrance.)

2. Structured Reconstruction Information

Below are four logical steps (or components) to guide the build from the ground up.

⸻

Component 1: Quartz_Block Foundation

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Rectangular Base Platform
	•	Material:
	    •	quartz_block
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	~35 quartz_block
	•	Dimension:
	    •	9 blocks wide (x), 7 blocks deep (z), 1 block tall (y = 0 to y = 1)
	•	Position:
	    •	Center the footprint so x ranges from -4 to +4, and z from -3 to +3, if desired.
	    •	The top surface ends at y = 1.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	You can make a small 2-block-wide “step” at the front (centered on the x-axis) by extending the foundation forward an extra block or two.
	    2.	Ensure the edges extend 1 block around what will become the walls, so the foundation is slightly larger than the enclosed interior.
	•	Description:
	    •	This raised platform provides the temple’s base, giving it a grander, elevated look. A short front step or landing leads to where the door will be placed.

Component 2: Front Columns

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Four Aligned Quartz_Block Columns
	•	Material:
	    •	quartz_block
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	~24 quartz_block (4 columns × 3 blocks tall + top crossbeam)
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Each column is 1×1 in footprint, 3 blocks tall (y = 1 to y = 4).
	    •	Spaced evenly across the front (9-wide base).
	•	Position:
	    •	Place the first column at the left edge of the platform’s front, the last at the right edge, and two evenly spaced in between.
	    •	All columns stand on top of the foundation (starting y = 1) and end at y = 4.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	After building each column 3 blocks high, connect them at the top with a row of quartz_block (the entablature or horizontal beam).
	    2.	Leave at least 2 or 3 blocks of space between the columns for symmetry.
	•	Description:
	    •	These columns form the hallmark of a Greek-inspired temple façade, supporting the roof’s front edge. A horizontal lintel ties them together at y = 4.

Component 3: Main Walls and Interior

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Quartz_Block Walls Enclosing a Rectangular Interior
	•	Material:
	    •	quartz_block
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	~60 quartz_block
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Outer walls occupy a 7×5 interior area behind the columns (plus 1-block-thick walls).
	    •	Built from y = 1 (foundation) up to y = 4 (top).
	•	Position:
	    •	Align the walls so they begin just behind the front columns, with a 1-block gap from the foundation edges on the left/right/back sides.
	    •	The top of the walls meets y = 4, same as the column lintel.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Add a centered doorway on the front wall, between the middle two columns.
	    2.	You can leave the interior hollow or add subdividing walls for a small room.
	    3.	If you want decorative corners, you can thicken them with extra quartz_block.
	•	Description:
	    •	This step encloses the building’s main room. The walls match the columns’ height so the roof can rest neatly on top.

Component 4: Red_Sandstone Roof

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Shallow Gabled Roof
	•	Material:
	    •	red_sandstone
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	~40 red_sandstone blocks
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Overhang ~9 blocks wide (matching the foundation), 7 blocks deep.
	    •	Height adds up to ~2 more blocks, peaking around y = 6.
	•	Position:
	    •	The lowest roof row sits at y = 4 (on top of the walls and columns).
	    •	Each row steps inward/upward by 1 block until you reach the top row (y = 6).
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Overhang the roof edges by 1 block on all sides for a classic temple look.
	    2.	If you prefer a gentler slope, keep it to two or three “steps” total.
	    3.	Make sure the front and back eaves line up horizontally for symmetry.
	•	Description:
	    •	The red_sandstone roof contrasts with the white quartz walls, giving the structure a bright, Mediterranean-inspired appearance. The stepped “layered” design is reminiscent of terracotta roof tiles.

Assembly Order Recap
	1.	Foundation: Build the 9×7 quartz_block base at y=0 → y=1, adding a small front step.
	2.	Front Columns: Place four 3-block-tall columns on top of the foundation at the front edge; connect them with a horizontal beam at y=4.
	3.	Walls and Interior: Fill in the rectangular walls behind the columns, up to y=4. Include a doorway if desired.
	4.	Roof: Layer red_sandstone from y=4 to y=6 in a stepped fashion, ensuring a slight overhang on all sides.

By following these steps, you can recreate this Greek temple–inspired structure entirely from quartz_block and red_sandstone, without reference to any background blocks.
