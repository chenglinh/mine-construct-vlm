1. Detailed Building Description
	1.	Overall Shape and Size
	•	The structure forms a squat, rounded bunker or shelter.
	•	Its footprint is roughly 7 blocks wide (x), 9 blocks deep (z), and it stands about 5 blocks tall (y) at its peak.
	•	A 2-block-wide and 2-block-tall entrance is centered on the front face.
	2.	Materials
	•	stone for the corner “ribs” or accent blocks.
	•	cobblestone for the main arched layers making up most of the roof and walls.
	3.	Approximate Layout
	•	The lowest layer is 7×9 in outline, with stone corners or edges and cobblestone filling in.
	•	Subsequent layers above become progressively narrower (stepping inward one block on each side) to form the arch.
	•	At the front (z=0), an opening is left for the entrance.
	4.	Approximate Block Counts
	•	stone: ~40 blocks (accent corners, side ribs, and highlights)
	•	cobblestone: ~80 blocks (main arch layers and fill)
	•	(Exact counts may vary slightly based on how you decorate the interior or shape the rear.)

2. Structured Reconstruction Information

Below are two main components, each built in sequence from the ground up.

⸻

Component 1: Foundation & Lower Walls

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Stone Corners with Cobblestone Infill (Layer 1)
	•	Material:
	    •	stone
	    •	cobblestone
	•	Number of Materials (Approx.):
	    •	stone: ~20
	    •	cobblestone: ~30
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Covers a 7×9 area (x by z), from y=0 to y=1 (1 block high).
	•	Position:
	    •	Center on (0,0,0) so that x ranges ~-3 to +3, z ranges ~0 to +8 (if you want the entrance at z=0).
	    •	The top of this layer is at y=1.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Outline the perimeter in stone, especially at the four corners and front edges.
	    2.	Fill the interior footprint with cobblestone.
	    3.	Leave a 2-wide gap at the front edge (z=0) for the doorway (from y=0 to y=2, once higher layers are added).
	•	Description:
	    •	This base forms a stout rectangular pad. The corner stone blocks and front opening begin to define the bunker’s shape.

Component 2: Arched Roof & Upper Layers

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Tiers of Cobblestone with Stone Accents
	•	Material:
	    •	stone
	    •	cobblestone
	•	Number of Materials (Approx.):
	    •	stone: ~20
	    •	cobblestone: ~50
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Extends from y=1 up to ~y=5 at the apex.
	    •	Each layer is 1 block high, stepping in ~1 block on each side as you go up, forming a curved profile.
	•	Position:
	    •	Build directly on top of the foundation.
	    •	The final topmost row sits at y=4 → y=5.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	For layer 2 (just above the foundation), place a ring of cobblestone about 5×7 with stone corners or “ribs” at the edges.
	    2.	For layer 3, reduce to ~3×5, again with stone corners or highlights.
	    3.	Continue narrowing each layer until you form a small top row (perhaps 1×3 or 1×1, depending on the desired arch shape).
	    4.	Keep the front entrance open by not filling the blocks directly above the 2-wide gap for the doorway.
	•	Description:
	    •	These stacked, progressively smaller layers create a half-dome or bunker roof. The stone highlights on each layer form ribs or ridges, enhancing the curved silhouette.

Putting It All Together
	1.	Foundation & Lower Walls (Component 1):
	•	Lay a 7×9 rectangular layer at ground level using stone corners and cobblestone fill.
	•	Reserve a 2-wide entrance in the front.
	2.	Arched Roof & Upper Layers (Component 2):
	•	Build multiple tiers of cobblestone, stepping in each layer as you go up.
	•	Add stone blocks at the edges or corners of each layer for a ribbed effect.
	•	Maintain a clear 2×2 entrance at the front.

When finished, you’ll have a squat, stone-and-cobblestone bunker with a distinctive arched profile—perfect as a small shelter or decorative structure.
