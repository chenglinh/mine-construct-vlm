1. Detailed Building Description
	1.	Overall Shape and Size
	•	The house footprint is roughly 7 blocks wide (x) by 7 blocks deep (z).
	•	The total height (from ground to the roof’s peak) is about 8 or 9 blocks (y).
	•	The style is reminiscent of a small “cottage” with half-timber framing (dark spruce beams, white infill).
	2.	Foundation and Porch
	•	A small cobblestone step leads up to an oak_planks porch, which wraps around the front face.
	•	The porch is ~7 blocks wide (matching the house’s front width) and extends ~2 blocks outward.
	3.	Walls
	•	Spruce_planks form vertical and horizontal beams.
	•	Quartz_block fills the gaps between beams, creating a white, plaster-like finish.
	•	The ground floor stands 3 blocks tall (y=0 to y=3), and a small “attic” or upper wall section extends above that (y=3 to ~y=5).
	4.	Roof
	•	A steeply angled roof of nether_bricks rises from about y=5 up to y=8 or y=9 at its peak.
	•	The roof overhangs on the sides by 1 block, giving the classic cottage silhouette.
	•	The front features a small, centered gable or “mini-roof” section above the white attic portion.
	5.	Approximate Block Counts
	•	cobblestone: ~10 (front step and minor foundation details)
	•	oak_planks: ~30 (porch decking and possible support posts)
	•	spruce_planks: ~60 (framing, beams, partial walls)
	•	quartz_block: ~40 (white wall infill)
	•	nether_bricks: ~60 (roof blocks, including ridges/overhang)

(Exact numbers may vary slightly, but these estimates will reproduce the visible exterior.)

2. Structured Reconstruction Information

Below are four main steps, each building on the last. You can adjust small details (like window openings or door placement) as desired.

⸻

Component 1: Cobblestone Step and Oak Porch

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Front Step + Wooden Porch
	•	Material:
	    •	cobblestone
	    •	oak_planks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	cobblestone: ~10
	    •	oak_planks: ~30
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Porch: ~7 blocks wide (x) × 2 blocks deep (z) × 1 block high (y).
	    •	Step: 1–2 cobblestone blocks at the front center, from ground level (y=0) up to porch level (y=1).
	•	Position:
	    •	Center the porch on the house’s front side, with x ranging from -3 to +3 and z = 0 or 1 (if you choose the front edge at z=1).
	    •	The top surface of the porch sits at y=1.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Place a row of oak_planks across the full 7-block width.
	    2.	Extend oak_planks 2 blocks outward (z-direction) for a comfortable front deck.
	    3.	Put a short cobblestone step (1 block tall) at the center front, aligned with the door position.
	•	Description:
	    •	This raised porch is the entry platform, giving the build a welcoming, rustic feel. The small cobblestone step helps bridge the ground to the deck.

Component 2: Ground-Floor Walls (Spruce & Quartz)

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Lower Wall Frame and White Infill
	•	Material:
	    •	spruce_planks
	    •	quartz_block
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	spruce_planks: ~30
	    •	quartz_block: ~20
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Overall 7×7 footprint continues behind the porch.
	    •	The wall height is 3 blocks (from y=1 to y=4).
	•	Position:
	    •	Build directly behind and above the porch, starting at y=1.
	    •	Extend walls around the perimeter, leaving a 5×5 interior if the walls are 1 block thick.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Outline the corners and edges with spruce_planks “beams.”
	    2.	Fill the spaces between beams with quartz_block.
	    3.	If you want windows or a doorway, leave 1×2 or 2×2 openings.
	•	Description:
	    •	This step creates the sturdy, half-timber style ground floor. The white quartz_block panels contrast with the dark spruce frame for a classic cottage look.

Component 3: Attic Walls (Spruce & Quartz)

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Small Upper Wall Section
	•	Material:
	    •	spruce_planks
	    •	quartz_block
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	spruce_planks: ~30
	    •	quartz_block: ~20
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Narrower upper portion that sits at y=4 through y=5, usually centered on the front/back.
	    •	Possibly 1–2 blocks inset from the lower floor’s perimeter (if you want a slight overhang).
	•	Position:
	    •	Placed above the lower walls, from y=4 to about y=5.
	    •	The front face might protrude to align with the roof’s gable.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Build a short “second floor” or attic front with spruce beams on the edges and quartz in the middle.
	    2.	Allow for a small upper window if desired (e.g., 1×1 or 2×1 opening).
	    3.	This portion helps shape the roofline and adds a second story illusion.
	•	Description:
	    •	The partial second level or attic area gives the house a cozy, layered profile, typical of medieval or fantasy cottages.

Component 4: Nether Bricks Roof

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Steep Cottage Roof
	•	Material:
	    •	nether_bricks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	nether_bricks: ~60
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Overhang covers a 7×7 area plus 1-block extension on each side, for ~9×9 total.
	    •	Height from y=5 to ~y=8 or y=9 at the highest ridge.
	•	Position:
	    •	Base of roof sits at y=5, overlapping the top edges of the walls/attic.
	    •	Slopes inward to meet at the center ridge.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	For each side, step the nether_bricks upward by 1 block as you go inward, creating a symmetrical A-frame.
	    2.	Extend the roof 1 block beyond the walls on the left/right sides for an authentic overhang.
	    3.	The front portion has a gable that frames the attic window.
	•	Description:
	    •	The dark nether_bricks roof contrasts strongly with the lighter walls. Its steep pitch fits medieval or rustic themes, and a small front gable gives character.

Putting It All Together
	1.	Cobblestone Step & Oak Porch at ground level (y=0 → y=1), spanning 7 wide × 2 deep.
	2.	Ground-Floor Walls (y=1 → y=4) in a half-timber style using spruce_planks beams and quartz_block infill.
	3.	Attic Walls (y=4 → y=5) for a partial second story, continuing the spruce+quartz design.
	4.	Nether Bricks Roof from y=5 → y=8 or y=9, forming a tall, cottage-like pitch.

Following these four steps, you can fully reconstruct this compact, storybook-style house using cobblestone, oak_planks, spruce_planks, quartz_block, and nether_bricks—all without needing any background blocks or extra materials.
