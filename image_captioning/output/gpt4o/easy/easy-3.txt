Detailed Building Description
This structure is a compact, box-like building composed of stone_bricks for its walls (bottom four layers) and oak_planks for the top layer. The footprint is 5×5 blocks, and the total height is 5 blocks (4 blocks of stone_bricks + 1 block of oak_planks on top). Although the top appears to use logs in a ring and a different wood for the center, only oak_planks are listed among the allowed wood blocks—so we will treat all visible wood as “oak_planks.”

Below the wooden top, the stone_bricks portion is likely hollow inside (3×3 interior) and open at both the bottom and top. You can place a floor inside or leave it empty. The wooden layer forms a flat 5×5 “roof.”
	•	Approximate Footprint: 5 (width) × 5 (depth)
	•	Overall Height: 5 blocks
	•	Materials: stone_bricks (for the base walls) and oak_planks (for the roof)
	•	Total Block Count: 64 stone_bricks (4 layers of a 5×5 ring with a 3×3 hollow) + 25 oak_planks (5×5 roof) = 89 blocks

Because the footprint is 5×5 (an odd dimension), you can align it so that the center of the building is at (0, 0, 0).

Structured Reconstruction Information

This build can be naturally split into two main components:
	1.	The Stone Bricks Base (4 layers)
	2.	The Wooden Top Layer (1 layer)

⸻

1. Stone Bricks Base (Walls)

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Stone Bricks Base (4 hollow layers)
	•	Material:
	    •	stone_bricks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	stone_bricks: 64 total
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Each layer has an outer dimension of 5×5 blocks with a 3×3 hollow interior.
	    •	Height of the base is 4 blocks (y = 0 through y = 4).
	•	Position:
	    •	Start at ground level, y = 0.
	    •	For a perfectly centered build at (0, 0, 0), let the interior extend from x = -1 to x = +1 and z = -1 to z = +1, with the walls at x or z = -2 and +2.
	    •	The top of this section finishes at y = 4.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Build one layer at a time: each ring layer requires 16 stone_bricks (5×5 outer, minus 3×3 hole).
	    2.	Place all four layers directly on top of each other for 4 levels of walls.
	    3.	Ensure the interior remains open for future customization.
	•	Description:
	    •	This base provides a sturdy, 4-block-tall enclosure of stone_bricks, ready for a roof or second floor. The hollow center can be used for an interior floor, windows, or doors as needed.

2. Wooden Top Layer

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Oak Planks Roof
	•	Material:
	    •	oak_planks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	oak_planks: 25 total
	•	Dimension:
	    •	A single 5×5 layer that sits atop the stone_bricks base.
	    •	5 blocks wide (x-axis), 5 blocks deep (z-axis), and 1 block high (y-axis).
	•	Position:
	    •	Start immediately above the 4th layer of stone_bricks, i.e., at y = 4.
	    •	Extends up to y = 5.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Cover the entire 5×5 area above the stone_bricks; this forms a flat roof.
	    2.	If you want a ring-like look, you can visually differentiate a “border” vs. “center,” but all are oak_planks in this plan.
	    3.	Make sure it neatly aligns with the wall edges.
	•	Description:
	    •	The wooden top seals the enclosure, forming a simple flat roof. It can serve as a final cap to the structure or a base for a second floor.

By following these two steps—first building the 4-layer stone_bricks enclosure, then capping it with the 5×5 oak_planks roof—you can fully reconstruct the building as shown. The hollow interior and simple roof make it a straightforward starter house or a foundation for further expansion.
