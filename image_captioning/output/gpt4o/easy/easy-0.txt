Detailed Building Description

From the image, the structure is a single-layer square “ring” built out of stone_bricks. It has an outer width of 8 blocks by 8 blocks and is 1 block tall, with a hollow interior measuring 6×6 blocks. Placed at ground level (y=0), this ring can serve as a simple foundation or an outline for a future building. No other materials are visible.
	•	Overall Dimensions: 8 (width) × 1 (height) × 8 (depth)
	•	Material Used: stone_bricks only
	•	Approximate Block Count: 28 distinct stone_bricks form the complete ring perimeter
	•	Coordinate System Note: Centered at (0,0,0) with y pointing upward. Because the ring is 8 blocks wide (an even number), the true “center” lies between blocks, so its corners can be placed symmetrically around the origin.

Structured Reconstruction Information

Below is a single reconstruction step, as the building in the image consists of only one distinct component (the stone_bricks ring).

1. Stone Bricks Ring

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Stone Bricks Square Ring Foundation
	•	Material:
	    •	stone_bricks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	stone_bricks: 28 blocks total
	•	Dimension:
	    •	The ring encloses an 8×8 footprint (width × depth), is 1 block tall, and is hollow in the middle.
	    •	In block units, it spans 8 blocks along x, 1 block along y, and 8 blocks along z.
	•	Position:
	    •	Start at ground level y = 0.
	    •	To center this ring at (0, 0, 0), place its corners so that x and z range from about -4 to +3 (8 blocks total in each horizontal direction).
	    •	The top of this single layer sits at y = 1.
	•	Tips:
	    •	Place the first row of 8 blocks for one side.
	    •	When turning each corner, do not double-place the corner block. Continue along the new side with 7 additional blocks so that each corner is shared.
	    •	After completing all four sides, you will have placed 28 distinct blocks in total.
	    •	Leave the 6×6 interior empty.
	•	Description:
	    •	This is a simple square ring of stone_bricks that can be used as a small foundation outline or a frame for further construction. The hollow center (6×6) is left open for future floors, decorations, or other builds.
