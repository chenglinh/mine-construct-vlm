Detailed Building Description
This structure is a single-layer ring of stone_bricks. Unlike a perfect square, it has diagonally offset corners, giving it a somewhat octagonal footprint. It sits at ground level (y = 0) and is exactly 1 block tall. The ring encloses a small interior space (roughly 2×2 blocks). Altogether, it uses about 12 stone_bricks to form the perimeter. The overall bounding box is approximately 4 blocks wide (x-axis), 4 blocks deep (z-axis), and 1 block tall (y-axis).
	•	Blocks Used:
	•	stone_bricks only
	•	Approximate Dimensions: ~4 (width) × 1 (height) × 4 (depth)
	•	Height/Scale Note: A Minecraft character (2 blocks tall) would stand half its height above this single-layer ring.

Structured Reconstruction Information

Because there is only one distinct component—a single ring—there is just one reconstruction step.

1. Irregular Stone Bricks Ring

Structure Information
	•	Structure: Irregular Stone Bricks Ring
	•	Material:
	    •	stone_bricks
	•	Number of Materials:
	    •	stone_bricks: 12 blocks total (approximately)
	•	Dimension:
	    •	Spans ~4 blocks along the x-axis and 4 along the z-axis; stands 1 block in height.
	    •	Encloses an interior of about 2×2 blocks in the center.
	•	Position:
	    •	Start at ground level (y = 0).
	    •	To center it around (0, 0, 0), you can position the ring so its corners range from about x = -2 to x = +1 and z = -2 to z = +1.
	    •	The top of this layer finishes at y = 1.
	•	Tips:
	    1.	Place a diagonal corner block, then fill 2 blocks along the edge, then place the next corner block.
	    2.	Continue this pattern all the way around so that each “side” of the ring has 2 blocks between diagonally offset corners.
	    3.	Ensure the interior remains hollow (2×2).
	•	Description:
	    •	This ring has four short sides, each joined by a single diagonal corner block. The resulting shape is slightly octagonal. It can serve as a decorative foundation, a planter border, or a base outline for a small structure.
