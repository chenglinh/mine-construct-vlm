### Detailed Building Description

The building appears to be a simple cube constructed with two distinct layers. The lower layer is made of cobblestone, while the upper layer is made of oak planks. The structure is 4 blocks wide, 4 blocks deep, and 2 blocks tall.

#### Lower Layer (Cobblestone)
- **Material:** cobblestone
- **Number of Materials:** 32 cobblestone blocks
- **Dimension:** 4x4x2
- **Position:** (0, 0, 0) to (3, 0, 3)
- **Tips:** Place cobblestone blocks first to form the base of the structure.
- **Description:** This forms the foundation of the building.

#### Upper Layer (Oak Planks)
- **Material:** oak planks
- **Number of Materials:** 16 oak planks
- **Dimension:** 4x4x1
- **Position:** (0, 2, 0) to (3, 2, 3)
- **Tips:** Place oak planks on top of the cobblestone layer, ensuring they align perfectly with the edges.
- **Description:** This forms the roof or upper surface of the building.

### Structured Reconstruction Information

#### Step 1: Construct the Cobblestone Foundation
- **Structure:** Cobblestone Foundation
- **Material:** cobblestone
- **Number of Materials:** 32 cobblestone blocks
- **Dimension:** 4x4x2
- **Position:** (0, 0, 0) to (3, 0, 3)
- **Tips:** Start by placing cobblestone blocks in a 4x4 grid pattern, extending 2 blocks upwards from the ground level.
- **Description:** This forms the base of the building.

#### Step 2: Add the Oak Plank Roof
- **Structure:** Oak Plank Roof
- **Material:** oak planks
- **Number of Materials:** 16 oak planks
- **Dimension:** 4x4x1
- **Position:** (0, 2, 0) to (3, 2, 3)
- **Tips:** Place oak planks horizontally across the top of the cobblestone foundation, ensuring they cover the entire width and depth of the structure.
- **Description:** This completes the building by adding a roof.
