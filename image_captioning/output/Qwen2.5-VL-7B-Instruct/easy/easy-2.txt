### Detailed Building Description

The building appears to be a simple rectangular enclosure made entirely of cobblestone blocks. It has no roof or other features, suggesting it could be a foundation or a container of some sort. The structure is symmetrical and has a consistent height across its length and width.

- **Material:** cobblestone
- **Dimensions:** 4 blocks wide, 2 blocks high, 4 blocks deep
- **Position:** Starting at (0, 0, 0)

### Structured Reconstruction Information

#### Step 1: Foundation
- **Structure:** Base Layer
- **Material:** cobblestone
- **Number of Materials:** 32 cobblestone blocks
- **Dimension:** 4x4x1
- **Position:** (0, 0, 0)
- **Tips:** Place the first layer of cobblestone blocks along the x and z axes to form the base.
- **Description:** This forms the bottom layer of the structure, providing a solid foundation.

#### Step 2: Side Walls
- **Structure:** Side Walls
- **Material:** cobblestone
- **Number of Materials:** 16 cobblestone blocks per side
- **Dimension:** 4x1x2 (each side)
- **Position:** Starting at (0, 1, 0) for the front wall, (0, 1, 3) for the back wall, (-1, 1, 0) for the left wall, and (3, 1, 0) for the right wall
- **Tips:** Place the cobblestone blocks vertically along the sides, ensuring they align with the base layer.
- **Description:** These walls extend upwards from the base layer, forming the sides of the enclosure.

#### Step 3: Top Wall
- **Structure:** Top Wall
- **Material:** cobblestone
- **Number of Materials:** 16 cobblestone blocks
- **Dimension:** 4x1x2
- **Position:** Starting at (0, 2, 0) for the front wall, (0, 2, 3) for the back wall, (-1, 2, 0) for the left wall, and (3, 2, 0) for the right wall
- **Tips:** Place the cobblestone blocks horizontally along the top of the side walls, ensuring they align with the base layer.
- **Description:** This completes the structure by adding the top layer of cobblestone blocks, forming a closed rectangular enclosure.
