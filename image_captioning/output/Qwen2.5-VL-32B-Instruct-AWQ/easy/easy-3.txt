### Detailed Building Description

The image shows a simple Minecraft structure consisting of two distinct layers:
1. **Lower Layer**: Constructed using **stone_bricks**. This layer forms the base of the structure.
2. **Upper Layer**: Constructed using **oak_planks**. This layer sits atop the stone_bricks and appears to be a flat, uniform surface.

The structure is a cube-like shape with a clear distinction between the two materials. The overall dimensions suggest a compact and functional design, likely intended as a small platform, container, or decorative element.

### Structured Reconstruction Information

#### **Step 1: Build the Lower Layer (Stone Bricks Base)**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Stone Brick Base
- **Material**: stone_bricks
- **Number of Materials**: 64 blocks of stone_bricks
- **Dimension**: 4 blocks × 4 blocks × 4 blocks (width × depth × height)
- **Position**: Start at (0, 0, 0) and extend to (4, 4, 4). The base will be flush with the ground level (y = 0).
- **Tips**: Ensure that the stone_bricks are placed in a perfect cube shape, with no gaps or misalignments. Use the grid overlay in Minecraft to help with precise placement.
- **Description**: This layer forms the sturdy foundation of the structure, providing a solid and uniform base for the upper layer.

#### **Step 2: Build the Upper Layer (Oak Planks Top)**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Oak Planks Top
- **Material**: oak_planks
- **Number of Materials**: 16 blocks of oak_planks
- **Dimension**: 4 blocks × 1 block × 4 blocks (width × height × depth)
- **Position**: Start at (0, 4, 0) and extend to (4, 5, 4). This layer sits directly on top of the stone_bricks base, flush with the top surface.
- **Tips**: Place the oak_planks in a single layer, ensuring they cover the entire top surface of the stone_bricks. Again, use the grid overlay for precision.
- **Description**: This layer serves as the flat, functional top surface of the structure, likely intended for use as a platform, container lid, or decorative element.

### Final Notes
- The structure is a simple cube with a two-material design. The stone_bricks provide a robust base, while the oak_planks offer a contrasting, natural-looking top surface.
- The dimensions and materials are chosen to ensure the structure is compact and easy to replicate. Adjustments can be made if additional features or modifications are desired.
