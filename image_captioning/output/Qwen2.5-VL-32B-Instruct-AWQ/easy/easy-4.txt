### Detailed Building Description

The Minecraft structure in the image is a simple, multi-layered tower-like building. It consists of three distinct segments:
1. **Base Layer**: Constructed from stone bricks, forming the foundation and lower walls.
2. **Middle Layer**: Built with sandstone, forming the upper walls and a flat roof.
3. **Top Layer**: A pyramid-like structure made of sandstone, serving as a decorative or functional element on top of the building.

The structure is symmetrical and appears to be designed for aesthetic purposes, possibly as a monument or decorative tower. The dimensions and materials are consistent with the typical block scale in Minecraft, where a character is 2 blocks tall.

### Structured Reconstruction Information

#### **Step 1: Base Layer (Stone Bricks)**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Base Layer
- **Material**: stone_bricks
- **Number of Materials**: 54 stone_bricks
- **Dimension**: 6 × 4 × 6 (Width × Height × Depth)
- **Position**: Start at (0, 0, 0) and extend to (6, 4, 6).
- **Tips**: Ensure the base is perfectly flat and level. Use a flat grass block surface as the foundation.
- **Description**: The base layer provides a sturdy foundation for the entire structure, made entirely of stone bricks for a classic, durable look.

#### **Step 2: Middle Layer (Sandstone Walls and Roof)**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Middle Layer
- **Material**: sandstone
- **Number of Materials**: 66 sandstone
- **Dimension**: 6 × 4 × 6 (Width × Height × Depth)
- **Position**: Start at (0, 4, 0) and extend to (6, 8, 6). This layer is built directly on top of the base layer.
- **Tips**: Align the sandstone blocks perfectly with the stone brick base to maintain symmetry. Ensure the top surface is flat to support the pyramid structure.
- **Description**: The middle layer consists of sandstone walls and a flat roof, providing a contrasting color to the base layer and setting the stage for the decorative top structure.

#### **Step 3: Top Layer (Sandstone Pyramid)**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Top Layer (Pyramid)
- **Material**: sandstone
- **Number of Materials**: 20 sandstone
- **Dimension**: 3 × 3 × 3 (Width × Height × Depth) for the base of the pyramid, tapering to a single block at the top.
- **Position**: Start at (1.5, 8, 1.5) relative to the center of the middle layer and extend upwards.
- **Tips**: Center the pyramid precisely on top of the middle layer. Use a step-by-step approach to build the pyramid, reducing the width and depth by one block on each level as you go up.
- **Description**: The top layer is a decorative sandstone pyramid, adding height and visual interest to the structure. It serves as the focal point of the design.

### Final Output

Here is the complete, self-contained guide for reconstructing the building:

- **Position**: Start at (0, 4, 0) and extend to (6, 8, 6).
- **Tips**: Align sandstone blocks with the stone brick base and ensure the top surface is flat.
- **Description**: Adds height and a contrasting color to the structure, serving as a platform for the pyramid.

#### **Step 3: Top Layer (Sandstone Pyramid)**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Top Layer (Pyramid)
- **Material**: sandstone
- **Number of Materials**: 20 sandstone
- **Dimension**: 3 × 3 × 3 (tapering to a single block at the top)
- **Position**: Start at (1.5, 8, 1.5) and extend upwards.
- **Tips**: Center the pyramid precisely and build it step-by-step, reducing the width and depth by one block on each level.
- **Description**: The decorative pyramid crowns the structure, adding visual interest and height.
