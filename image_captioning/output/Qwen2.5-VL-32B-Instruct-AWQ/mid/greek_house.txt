### Detailed Building Description

The Minecraft structure in the image appears to be a small, classical-style building with a prominent staircase leading up to it. The building features a clean, symmetrical design with a flat roof and a set of columns supporting the front facade. Here’s a breakdown of the visible components:

1. **Foundation and Base Platform**:
   - The structure is elevated on a flat platform made of white blocks, likely quartz blocks.
   - The platform extends outward to create a landing area.

2. **Columns**:
   - Four tall, slender columns made of white blocks (likely quartz blocks) support the front facade.
   - The columns are evenly spaced and aligned symmetrically.

3. **Front Facade**:
   - The facade includes a set of windows and a door, all framed with white blocks.
   - The door is made of oak planks, and the windows are glass panes.

4. **Roof**:
   - The roof is a stepped design, made of orange blocks, likely sandstone.
   - The steps are symmetrical and lead up to the top of the structure.

### Structured Reconstruction Information

Below is the step-by-step guide to reconstruct the building, broken down into distinct components:

---

#### **Step 1: Build the Base Platform**
**Structure Information:**
- **Structure**: Base Platform
- **Material**: quartz_block
- **Number of Materials**: 48 quartz_blocks
- **Dimension**: 8 blocks (width) × 1 block (height) × 6 blocks (depth)
- **Position**: Start at (−4, 0, −3) and extend to (3, 1, 2).
- **Tips**: Ensure the platform is flat and level. This will serve as the foundation for the rest of the structure.
- **Description**: The base platform provides a stable and elevated foundation for the building.

---

#### **Step 2: Build the Columns**
**Structure Information:**
- **Structure**: Columns
- **Material**: quartz_block
- **Number of Materials**: 48 quartz_blocks
- **Dimension**: 1 block (width) × 6 blocks (height) × 1 block (depth) per column
- **Position**: 
  - Column 1: Start at (−3, 1, 2) and extend to (−3, 7, 2).
  - Column 2: Start at (−1, 1, 2) and extend to (−1, 7, 2).
  - Column 3: Start at (1, 1, 2) and extend to (1, 7, 2).
  - Column 4: Start at (3, 1, 2) and extend to (3, 7, 2).
- **Tips**: Align the columns symmetrically along the x-axis. Ensure they are evenly spaced and reach the same height.
- **Description**: The columns support the front facade and add a classical architectural element to the design.

#### **Step 3: Build the Front Facade**
**Structure Information:**
- **Structure**: Front Facade
- **Material**: quartz_block, oak_planks, glass_pane
- **Number of Materials**:
  - 36 quartz_blocks
  - 6 oak_planks
  - 12 glass_panes
- **Dimension**: 8 blocks (width) × 3 blocks (height) × 1 block (depth)
- **Position**: 
  - Start at (−4, 7, 2) and extend to (3, 10, 2).
  - Door: Start at (−1, 8, 2) and extend to (1, 10, 2) using oak_planks.
  - Windows: Start at (−4, 8, 2) and extend to (−3, 10, 2) for the left window, and start at (2, 8, 2) and extend to (3, 10, 2) for the right window, using glass_panes.
- **Tips**: Ensure the door and windows are centered and aligned with the columns. The facade should be flush with the top of the columns.
- **Description**: The front facade includes a door and two windows, framed with quartz blocks for a cohesive look.

#### **Step 4: Build the Roof**
**Structure Information:**
- **Structure**: Stepped Roof
- **Material**: sandstone
- **Number of Materials**: 30 sandstone_blocks
- **Dimension**: 8 blocks (width) × 3 blocks (height) × 1 block (depth) at the base, tapering to 4 blocks (width) × 3 blocks (height) × 1 block (depth) at the top.
- **Position**: 
  - Start at (−4, 10, 2) and extend to (3, 13, 2) for the base layer.
  - Each subsequent layer is offset inward by 1 block on both sides.
  - Final layer: Start at (−2, 13, 2) and extend to (2, 16, 2).
- **Tips**: Build the roof in steps, ensuring each layer is centered and aligned with the previous one. The topmost layer should be flush with the top of the facade.
- **Description**: The stepped roof adds a classical and elegant touch to the structure, providing a visually appealing finish.
