### Detailed Building Description

The building in the image is a small, dome-like structure made primarily of **cobblestone**. It appears to be a simple, standalone structure with a rounded top and a central entrance. The structure is elevated slightly above the ground, suggesting a small foundation or platform. The overall design is compact and symmetrical, with a focus on the dome shape.

### Structured Reconstruction Information

#### **Step 1: Foundation**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Foundation
- **Material**: cobblestone
- **Number of Materials**: 16 cobblestone blocks
- **Dimension**: 4 × 1 × 4 blocks
- **Position**: Start at (0, 0, 0). The foundation spans from (0, 0, 0) to (3, 0, 3).
- **Tips**: Ensure the foundation is flat and level to provide a stable base for the structure.
- **Description**: The foundation provides a solid base for the dome structure, elevating it slightly above the ground.

#### **Step 2: Main Dome Structure**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Main Dome
- **Material**: cobblestone
- **Number of Materials**: 48 cobblestone blocks
- **Dimension**: Approximately 5 × 4 × 5 blocks (height includes the foundation)
- **Position**: Start at (0, 1, 0). The dome structure spans from (0, 1, 0) to (4, 4, 4), with the topmost blocks forming a rounded shape.
- **Tips**: Build the dome in layers, starting from the base and working upwards. Use symmetry to ensure the dome is even and rounded. The top blocks should be placed to create a smooth, curved appearance.
- **Description**: The main dome forms the core of the structure, providing a rounded, protective shell.

#### **Step 3: Entrance**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Entrance
- **Material**: cobblestone (for the frame) and air (for the opening)
- **Number of Materials**: 8 cobblestone blocks
- **Dimension**: 1 × 2 × 1 block opening, framed by cobblestone
- **Position**: The entrance is centered on the front face of the dome, spanning from (2, 1, 0) to (2, 2, 0). The opening is created by removing blocks from the cobblestone structure.
- **Tips**: Ensure the entrance is centered and aligned with the dome's symmetry. The height of the entrance should allow a typical Minecraft character (2 blocks tall) to pass through comfortably.
- **Description**: The entrance provides access to the interior of the dome structure.

#### **Step 4: Interior (Optional)**
Structure Information:
- **Structure**: Interior
- **Material**: air (empty space)
- **Number of Materials**: N/A (no blocks are added)
- **Dimension**: Approximately 3 × 2 × 3 blocks (interior space)
- **Position**: The interior is defined by the space inside the dome, starting at (1, 1, 1) and ending at (3, 2, 3).
- **Tips**: The interior is simply the empty space within the dome structure. No additional blocks are required unless you wish to add decorations or furnishings.
- **Description**: The interior is the usable space within the dome, providing a small sheltered area.

### Final Notes
- The structure is symmetrical and compact, with a focus on the dome shape.
- The entrance is centrally located on the front face, providing easy access.
- The use of cobblestone gives the structure a rugged, natural appearance.
- The overall design is simple and functional, suitable for a small shelter or decorative element in a Minecraft world.
