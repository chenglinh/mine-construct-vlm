Structured Reconstruction Information:

Structure Information 1:

*   Structure: Base
*   Material: Stone
*   Number of Materials: 16
*   Dimension: 4 blocks by 4 blocks by 1 block
*   Position: (0, 0, 0)
*   Tips: Place the base in the center of the coordinate system.
*   Description: The base provides the foundation for the structure.

Structure Information 2:

*   Structure: Wall 1
*   Material: Stone
*   Number of Materials: 8
*   Dimension: 4 blocks by 1 block by 1 block
*   Position: (0, 1, 0) (on top of the base)
*   Tips: Align the wall with the base and ensure it is centered.
*   Description: The first wall provides additional support and structure to the building.

Structure Information 3:

*   Structure: Wall 2
*   Material: Stone
*   Number of Materials: 8
*   Dimension: 4 blocks by 1 block by 1 block
*   Position: (0, 3, 0) (on top of the first wall)
*   Tips: Align the second wall with the first wall and ensure it is centered.
*   Description: The second wall completes the rectangular shape of the structure.

Structure Information 4:

*   Structure: Top
*   Material: Stone
*   Number of Materials: 4
*   Dimension: 4 blocks by 4 blocks by 1 block
*   Position: (0, 5, 0) (on top of the second wall)
*   Tips: Place the top flatly on top of the second wall.
