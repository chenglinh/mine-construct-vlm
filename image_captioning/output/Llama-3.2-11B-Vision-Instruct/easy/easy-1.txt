The building in the image is a square structure with a flat top and a hollow center. It appears to be made of stone blocks, with a total of 12 blocks used in its construction.

**Detailed Building Description**

The building can be decomposed into two distinct segments: the outer wall and the inner hollow space.

*   **Outer Wall**
    *   Material: stone blocks
    *   Number of Materials: 12
    *   Dimension: 4 blocks wide, 4 blocks long, and 1 block tall
    *   Position: Starting at (0, 0, 0) and extending 4 blocks in the x and z directions, with the top surface at y = 1
*   **Inner Hollow Space**
    *   Material: air
    *   Number of Materials: 0
    *   Dimension: 4 blocks wide, 4 blocks long, and 1 block tall
    *   Position: Inside the outer wall, centered at (2, 2, 2)

**Structured Reconstruction Information**

**Step 1: Build the Outer Wall**

Structure Information:

*   Structure: Outer Wall
*   Material: stone blocks
*   Number of Materials: 12
*   Dimension: 4 blocks wide, 4 blocks long, and 1 block tall
*   Position: Starting at (0, 0, 0) and extending 4 blocks in the x and z directions, with the top surface at y = 1
*   Tips: Use stone blocks to build the wall, making sure to leave a small gap in the center for the inner hollow space.
*   Description: The outer wall serves as the foundation of the building.

**Step 2: Create the Inner Hollow Space**

Structure Information:

*   Structure: Inner Hollow Space
*   Material: air
*   Number of Materials: 0
*   Dimension: 4 blocks wide, 4 blocks long, and 1 block tall
*   Position: Inside the outer wall, centered at (2, 2, 2)
*   Tips: Remove the blocks in the center of the outer wall to create the hollow space.
*   Description: The inner hollow space provides a clear path through the building.
