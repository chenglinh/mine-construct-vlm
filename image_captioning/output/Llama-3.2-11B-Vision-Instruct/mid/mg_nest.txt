**Detailed Building Description**

The building is composed of three main components: the base, the walls, and the roof.

*   **Base**
    *   Material: Stone
    *   Number of Materials: 4 blocks
    *   Dimensions: 2 blocks wide, 2 blocks long, 1 block high
    *   Position: Starting at (0, 0, 0)
    *   Tips: Place the base at the origin of the coordinate system.
    *   Description: The base provides a foundation for the building.
*   **Walls**
    *   Material: Cobblestone
    *   Number of Materials: 8 blocks
    *   Dimensions: 2 blocks wide, 2 blocks long, 2 blocks high
    *   Position: Starting at (0, 1, 0) and extending 2 blocks up from the base
    *   Tips: Place the walls directly above the base, ensuring they are centered.
    *   Description: The walls provide structural support and define the building's shape.
*   **Roof**
    *   Material: Oak Planks
    *   Number of Materials: 4 blocks
    *   Dimensions: 2 blocks wide, 2 blocks long, 1 block high
    *   Position: Starting at (0, 3, 0) and extending 1 block above the walls
    *   Tips: Place the roof directly above the walls, ensuring it is centered and flush with the top of the walls.
    *   Description: The roof provides a flat surface and completes the building's structure.

**Structured Reconstruction Information**

**Step 1: Base**

*   Structure: Base
*   Material: Stone
*   Number of Materials: 4 blocks
*   Dimension: 2 blocks wide, 2 blocks long, 1 block high
*   Position: Starting at (0, 0, 0)
*   Tips: Place the base at the origin of the coordinate system.
*   Description: The base provides a foundation for the building.

**Step 2: Walls**

*   Structure: Walls
*   Material: Cobblestone
*   Number of Materials: 8 blocks
*   Dimension: 2 blocks wide, 2 blocks long, 2 blocks high
*   Position: Starting at (0, 1, 0) and extending 2 blocks up from the base
*   Tips: Place the walls directly above the base, ensuring they are centered.
*   Description: The walls provide structural support and define the building's shape.

**Step 3: Roof**

*   Structure: Roof
*   Material: Oak Planks
*   Number of Materials: 4 blocks
