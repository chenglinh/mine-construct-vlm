### **Detailed Building Description**

The building in the image is a simple, cube-shaped structure composed of two distinct materials: **cobblestone** and **hay bales**. The structure appears to be a basic block tower or monument, with a cobblestone base and a hay bale top. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

1. **Cobblestone Base**:
   - The base is made entirely of cobblestone blocks.
   - It forms the lower portion of the structure, providing a sturdy foundation.
   - The base appears to be a cube with a uniform thickness.

2. **Hay Bale Top**:
   - The top section is made entirely of hay bales.
   - It sits directly on top of the cobblestone base, forming a flat, uniform layer.
   - The hay bale layer adds a contrasting texture and color to the structure.

### **Structured Reconstruction Information**

Below is the step-by-step reconstruction information for the building, broken down into components:

---

#### **Structure Information: Cobblestone Base**
- **Structure**: Cobblestone Base
- **Material**: 
  - Cobblestone
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Cobblestone: 64 blocks
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 4 blocks
  - Height: 4 blocks
  - Depth: 4 blocks
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (0, 0, 0)
  - Spatial Extent: 
    - x: -2 to 1
    - y: 0 to 3
    - z: -2 to 1
- **Tips**:
  - Ensure the cobblestone blocks are placed in a perfect cube shape.
  - Use a flat, level surface to start building.
- **Description**:
  - The cobblestone base provides a solid foundation for the structure. Its uniform cube shape ensures stability and symmetry.

#### **Structure Information: Hay Bale Top**
- **Structure**: Hay Bale Top
- **Material**: 
  - Hay Bale
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Hay Bale: 16 blocks
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 4 blocks
  - Height: 1 block
  - Depth: 4 blocks
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (0, 4, 0)
  - Spatial Extent: 
    - x: -2 to 1
    - y: 4 to 4
    - z: -2 to 1
- **Tips**:
  - Place the hay bales directly on top of the cobblestone base to form a flat, uniform layer.
  - Ensure the hay bales are aligned perfectly to maintain the cube shape.
- **Description**:
  - The hay bale top adds a contrasting texture and color to the structure. It sits flush on top of the cobblestone base, completing the cube shape.

### **Reconstruction Summary**

1. **Step 1: Build the Cobblestone Base**
   - Place 64 cobblestone blocks to form a 4x4x4 cube.
   - Start at position (0, 0, 0) and extend to (1, 3, 1).

2. **Step 2: Add the Hay Bale Top**
   - Place 16 hay bale blocks on top of the cobblestone base.
   - Start at position (0, 4, 0) and extend to (1, 4, 1).

By following these steps, you can accurately reconstruct the building as seen in the image.
