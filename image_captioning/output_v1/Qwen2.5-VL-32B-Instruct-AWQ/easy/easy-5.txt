### **Detailed Building Description**

The building in the image is a compact, cube-shaped structure with a simple yet functional design. It appears to be a small house or shed, constructed using two primary materials: **cobblestone** for the main body and **oak planks** for the roof. The structure includes a door and a window, adding to its functionality. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the visible components:

1. **Main Body**: Constructed from cobblestone, forming the walls and foundation of the building.
2. **Roof**: Made of oak planks, with a slightly sloped design.
3. **Door**: Positioned on one of the walls, made of oak door blocks.
4. **Window**: A glass pane window, framed by cobblestone, located on the side opposite the door.
5. **Foundation**: The base of the structure is flush with the ground, suggesting no additional foundation blocks are used.

### **Structured Reconstruction Information**

Below is the step-by-step guide to reconstruct the building, broken down into distinct components:

---

#### **Structure Information: Main Body**
- **Structure**: Main Body (Cobblestone Walls)
- **Material**:

- **Number of Materials**:
  - Cobblestone: 64 blocks
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 4 blocks
  - Height: 4 blocks
  - Depth: 4 blocks
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (0, 0, 0)
  - Extent: (0, 0, 0) to (4, 4, 4)
- **Tips**:
  - Ensure all walls are perfectly aligned and flush with each other.
  - Leave a 2-block gap on one side for the door and a 1-block gap on the opposite side for the window.
- **Description**:
  - The main body forms the core of the structure, providing the walls and foundation.

#### **Structure Information: Door**
- **Structure**: Door (Oak Door)
- **Material**:
  - Oak Door
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Oak Door: 1 (2 blocks tall)
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 1 block
  - Height: 2 blocks
  - Depth: 1 block
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (3, 1, 2)
  - Extent: (3, 1, 2) to (3, 2, 2)
- **Tips**:
  - Place the door on the side of the building where the 2-block gap was left in the main body.
  - Ensure the door is aligned vertically with the ground level.
- **Description**:
  - The door provides access to the interior of the building.

#### **Structure Information: Window**
- **Structure**: Window (Glass Pane with Cobblestone Frame)
- **Material**:
  - Glass Pane
  - Cobblestone
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Glass Pane: 4 blocks
  - Cobblestone: 8 blocks
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 2 blocks
  - Height: 2 blocks
  - Depth: 1 block
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (1, 1, 2)
  - Extent: (1, 1, 2) to (2, 2, 2)
- **Tips**:
  - Place the window on the side of the building opposite the door.
  - Use cobblestone to frame the glass panes, ensuring a clean and sturdy structure.
- **Description**:
  - The window allows light into the interior and adds aesthetic detail to the building.

---

#### **Structure Information: Roof**
- **Structure**: Roof (Oak Planks)
- **Material**:
  - Oak Planks
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Oak Planks: 16 blocks
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 4 blocks
  - Height: 1 block
  - Depth: 4 blocks
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (0, 4, 0)
  - Extent: (0, 4, 0) to (4, 4, 4)
- **Tips**:
  - Place the oak planks on top of the main body, covering the entire surface.
  - Ensure the roof is level and flush with the edges of the walls.
- **Description**:
  - The roof completes the structure, providing a simple yet effective covering.

### **Final Notes**
- **Overall Dimensions**: The entire structure is 4 blocks wide, 4 blocks tall, and 4 blocks deep.
- **Character Scale**: The structure is approximately 2 times the height of a typical Minecraft character (2 blocks tall), making it a comfortable size for a small house or shed.
- **Placement**: The building is centered at (0, 0, 0) in the coordinate system, with all components aligned to ensure symmetry and stability.

By following the above steps, you can accurately reconstruct the building as seen in the image. 

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{1. Main Body: Cobblestone (64 blocks, 4x4x4)} \\
&\text{2. Door: Oak Door (1, at (3, 1, 2))} \\
&\text{3. Window: Glass Pane (4) + Cobblestone (8), at (1, 1, 2)} \\
&\text{4. Roof: Oak Planks (16, at (0, 4, 0))} \\
\end{aligned}
