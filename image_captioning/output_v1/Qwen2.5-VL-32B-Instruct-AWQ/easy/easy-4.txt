### **Detailed Building Description**

The Minecraft structure in the image is a simple, multi-layered tower-like building. It consists of two primary materials: **cobblestone** and **wooden planks**. The structure is composed of the following segments:

1. **Base Layer (Cobblestone)**:
   - The base layer is made entirely of cobblestone blocks, forming a solid foundation.
   - The base layer appears to be a cube with a height of 4 blocks.

2. **Upper Layer (Wooden Planks)**:
   - The upper layer is made of wooden planks, forming a smaller cube on top of the cobblestone base.
   - The wooden planks layer is slightly smaller in width and depth compared to the cobblestone base, creating a stepped appearance.

3. **Pyramid Roof (Wooden Planks)**:
   - On top of the wooden planks layer, there is a small pyramid-like structure also made of wooden planks.
   - The pyramid is a simple, three-tiered structure, with each tier decreasing in size as it goes upward.

### **Structured Reconstruction Information**

Below is the step-by-step reconstruction information for the building, broken down into distinct components:

---

#### **Structure Information: Base Layer (Cobblestone)**

#### **Structure Information: Upper Layer (Wooden Planks)**
- **Structure**: Upper Layer
- **Material**: 
  - Wooden Planks
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Wooden Planks: 27 blocks
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 3 blocks
  - Height: 1 block
  - Depth: 3 blocks
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (0.5, 4, 0.5)
  - Extent: (0.5, 4, 0.5) to (3.5, 5, 3.5)
- **Tips**:
  - Align the wooden planks layer directly on top of the cobblestone base.
  - Center the wooden planks layer to create a stepped appearance.
- **Description**:
  - The upper layer is made of wooden planks and sits on top of the cobblestone base. It is slightly smaller in width and depth to create a tiered effect.

  - Depth: 3 blocks (base), tapering to 1 block at the top
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: (1, 5, 1)
  - Extent: (1, 5, 1) to (2, 8, 2) for the topmost block
- **Tips**:
  - Build the pyramid in tiers, reducing the size of each layer as you go up.
  - Center the pyramid directly on top of the wooden planks layer.
- **Description**:
  - The pyramid roof is a simple, three-tiered structure made of wooden planks. It adds a decorative and functional element to the top of the building.

### **Summary of Materials Needed**
- **Cobblestone**: 64 blocks
- **Wooden Planks**: 37 blocks

### **Final Notes**
- The structure is designed to be simple and symmetrical.
- Ensure all blocks are placed precisely to maintain the intended stepped and tiered appearance.
- The building is approximately 8 blocks tall (4 blocks for the cobblestone base, 1 block for the wooden planks layer, and 3 blocks for the pyramid roof).

By following the above instructions, the building can be accurately reconstructed without reference to the original image.
