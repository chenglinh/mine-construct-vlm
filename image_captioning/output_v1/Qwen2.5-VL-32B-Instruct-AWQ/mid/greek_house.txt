### **Detailed Building Description**

The Minecraft building in the image appears to be a small, classical-style structure resembling a Greek or Roman temple. It features a prominent set of stairs leading up to a platform, which supports a rectangular base with columns and a roof. The structure is symmetrical and uses a limited palette of materials, primarily quartz blocks and spruce wood planks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the visible components:

1. **Stairs**: A set of ascending stairs made of quartz blocks, leading up to the platform.
2. **Platform**: A flat, rectangular platform made of quartz blocks, supporting the main structure.
3. **Columns**: Four tall, rectangular columns made of spruce wood planks, evenly spaced along the front of the structure.
4. **Base**: A rectangular base made of quartz blocks, forming the foundation of the structure.
5. **Roof**: A triangular roof made of spruce wood planks, resting on top of the columns and base.
6. **Door**: A wooden door (oak door) is centered on the front of the structure, providing an entrance.

#### **Structure Information: Columns**
- **Structure**: Four tall, rectangular columns.
- **Material**:
  - Spruce Wood Planks
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Spruce Wood Planks: 48
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 1 block
  - Height: 6 blocks
  - Depth: 1 block
- **Position**:
  - Column 1: Starting at `(1, 6, 10)` (bottom-left corner of the first column)
  - Column 2: Starting at `(3, 6, 10)` (bottom-left corner of the second column)
  - Column 3: Starting at `(6, 6, 10)` (bottom-left corner of the third column)
  - Column 4: Starting at `(8, 6, 10)` (bottom-left corner of the fourth column)
- **Tips**:
  - Ensure all columns are the same height and evenly spaced.
  - Align the columns so they are directly under the roof.
- **Description**:
  - The columns support the roof and add a classical architectural element to the structure.

  - Spruce Wood Planks
- **Number of Materials**:
  - Spruce Wood Planks: 24
- **Dimension**:
  - Width: 8 blocks (at the base)
  - Height: 3 blocks (triangular height)
  - Depth: 1 block
- **Position**:
  - Starting Position: `(1, 7, 13)` (bottom-left corner of the roof)
  - Extent: The roof spans from `(1, 7, 13)` to `(8, 9, 13)` (top-right corner of the roof).
- **Tips**:
  - Build the roof in a triangular shape, with the height increasing by one block for each row.
  - Ensure the roof is symmetrical and centered over the base and columns.
- **Description**:
  - The roof completes the classical design and provides a focal point for the structure.
