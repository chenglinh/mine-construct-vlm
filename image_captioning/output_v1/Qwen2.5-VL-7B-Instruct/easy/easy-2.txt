### Detailed Building Description

The building in the image appears to be a simple rectangular enclosure made entirely of stone blocks. It has no roof or additional features, suggesting it might be a foundation or a container. The structure is symmetrical and has a consistent height across its length and width.

- **Blocks Used**: Stone Blocks
- **Component**: Rectangular Enclosure
- **Dimensions**: 6 blocks wide, 5 blocks deep, and 2 blocks high
- **Position**: Centered around the origin (0, 0, 0)
- **Tips**: Ensure the corners are aligned properly to maintain the rectangular shape.
- **Description**: This structure serves as a basic enclosure, possibly for holding items or as a boundary marker.

### Structured Reconstruction Information

#### Step 1: Construct the Base
```plaintext
Structure Information:
    - Structure: Base
    - Material: Stone Blocks
    - Number of Materials: 60 (6 blocks wide * 5 blocks deep * 2 blocks high)
    - Dimension: 6x5x2
    - Position: (0, 0, 0) to (5, 0, 4)
    - Tips: Place the first layer of blocks from (0, 0, 0) to (5, 0, 4). Then stack the second layer directly above the first layer.
    - Description: This forms the base of the rectangular enclosure.

#### Step 2: Construct the Walls
```plaintext
Structure Information:
    - Structure: Wall
    - Material: Stone Blocks
    - Number of Materials: 28 (6 blocks wide * 2 blocks high + 5 blocks deep * 2 blocks high - 4 corner blocks counted twice)
    - Dimension: 6x2x2 (top and bottom layers) and 5x2x2 (left and right layers)
    - Position: (0, 1, 0) to (5, 1, 4) for top layer; (0, 0, 0) to (5, 0, 4) for bottom layer
    - Tips: Place the top layer of blocks from (0, 1, 0) to (5, 1, 4). Then place the bottom layer from (0, 0, 0) to (5, 0, 4). Ensure the corners are properly connected.
    - Description: This forms the vertical walls of the rectangular enclosure.
