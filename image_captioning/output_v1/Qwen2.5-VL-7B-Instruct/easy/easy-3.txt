### Detailed Building Description

The building appears to be a simple cube constructed from two different materials: stone blocks and oak wood planks. The lower portion of the cube is made of stone blocks, while the upper portion is covered with oak wood planks. The cube has a uniform height and width, suggesting it was built as a single entity rather than a multi-component structure.

- **Material**: 
  - Stone Blocks
  - Oak Wood Planks
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Width: 4 blocks
  - Height: 4 blocks
  - Depth: 4 blocks
- **Position**:
  - Centered at coordinates (0, 0, 0)
- **Tips**: 
  - Ensure the stone blocks are placed first to form the base.
  - Place the oak wood planks on top of the stone blocks to cover the entire surface.
- **Description**: 
  - This is a simple cube structure, likely intended as a basic platform or a placeholder for further construction.

Structure Information:
    - Structure: Top Layer
    - Material: Oak Wood Planks
    - Number of Materials: 64 (4 x 4 x 4)
    - Dimension: 4 blocks wide, 4 blocks high, 4 blocks deep
    - Position: (0, 3, 0) to (3, 3, 3)
