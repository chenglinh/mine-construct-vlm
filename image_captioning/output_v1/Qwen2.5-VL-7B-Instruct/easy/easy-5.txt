### Structured Reconstruction Information

#### Structure Information: Foundation
- **Structure**: Foundation
- **Material**: Stone Blocks
- **Number of Materials**: 72 (6x6x2)
- **Dimension**: 6x6x2
- **Position**: (0, 0, 0) to (5, 0, 5)
- **Tips**: Place stone blocks in a 6x6 grid starting from the origin (0, 0, 0) to (5, 0, 5). Ensure the blocks are aligned properly to form a solid base.
- **Description**: This forms the stable foundation of the building.

#### Structure Information: Walls
- **Structure**: Walls
- **Material**: Stone Blocks
- **Number of Materials**: 144 (6x6x4)
- **Dimension**: 6x6x4
- **Position**: (0, 1, 0) to (5, 5, 5)
- **Tips**: Build the walls by placing stone blocks vertically from the foundation up to the roof level. Start from the bottom left corner (0, 1, 0) and extend to the bottom right corner (5, 1, 5), then move to the next row and continue until you reach the top level.
- **Description**: These form the outer walls of the building, providing structural integrity.

#### Structure Information: Roof
- **Structure**: Roof
- **Material**: Wooden Planks
- **Number of Materials**: 36 (6x6x1)
- **Dimension**: 6x6x1
- **Position**: (0, 6, 0) to (5, 7, 5)
- **Tips**: Place wooden planks horizontally across the top of the walls, ensuring they cover the entire width and depth of the building. Start from the bottom left corner (0, 6, 0) and extend to the bottom right corner (5, 6, 5), then move to the next row and continue until you reach the top level.
- **Description**: This covers the top surface of the building, forming the roof.

#### Structure Information: Door
- **Structure**: Door
- **Material**: Wooden Planks
- **Number of Materials**: 8 (2x2x2)
- **Dimension**: 2x2x2
- **Position**: (3, 1, 3) to (4, 3, 4)
- **Tips**: Place wooden planks to form a door frame. Start by placing two vertical wooden planks on either side of the desired door opening, then place two horizontal wooden planks on top and below the vertical planks.
- **Description**: This provides access to the interior of the building.

#### Structure Information: Window
- **Structure**: Window
- **Material**: Glass Panes
- **Number of Materials**: 4 (2x2x1)
- **Dimension**: 2x2x1
- **Position**: (2, 2, 2) to (3, 3, 3)
- **Tips**: Place glass panes to form a window frame. Start by placing two vertical glass panes on either side of the desired window opening, then place two horizontal glass panes on top and below the vertical panes.
- **Description**: This allows natural light and ventilation into the building.
