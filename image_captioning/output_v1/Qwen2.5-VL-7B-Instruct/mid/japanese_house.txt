### Reconstruction Instructions

To rebuild this house, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Start with the Foundation:**
   - Begin by placing 16 cobblestone blocks to form a 4x4 square, 2 blocks tall. This will serve as the base of the house.

2. **Construct the Walls:**
   - On top of the cobblestone foundation, place 16 wooden planks to create the walls. Ensure they are perfectly aligned to form a 4x4 square, 2 blocks tall.

3. **Add the Roof:**
   - Place 8 red brick blocks to form the base of the roof, starting from one corner and extending diagonally across the top of the house. Continue placing more red bricks to form the triangular shape, ensuring the slope is consistent.
   - Add additional red bricks to complete the roof, making sure the edges are smooth and the overall shape is symmetrical.

4. **Install the Door:**
   - Center the wooden door on the front facade of the house, ensuring it is flush with the wooden planks.

5. **Add Windows:**
   - Place 4 glass panes to form two small windows on the side of the house. Position them symmetrically, one above the other, to match the design.

6. **Place the Bench:**
   - On either side of the entrance, place 4 wooden planks to form the benches. Ensure they are level and extend slightly beyond the entrance area.

7. **Add Greenery:**
   - Plant some grass blocks around the base of the house to create a natural border. You can also add flowers to enhance the aesthetic appeal.

8. **Final Touches:**
   - Ensure all blocks are properly aligned and the structure is stable.
   - Add any additional decorative elements like signs, fences, or more plants to personalize the house further.
