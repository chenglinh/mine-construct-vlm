**Detailed Building Description**

The building is constructed using a combination of blocks, including:

* Cobblestone blocks for the foundation and walls
* Glass panes for the windows
* Oak planks for the roof and door frame
* A single block of dirt for the door

The building can be decomposed into two main components:

1. **Foundation and Walls**: The foundation is a 3x3 block square, centered at (0, -1, 0). The walls are made of cobblestone blocks and extend 5 blocks in height, from y = -1 to y = -6. The walls are 3 blocks wide and 5 blocks long, with the entrance located at (1, -1, 0).
2. **Roof and Door Frame**: The roof is made of oak planks and covers the entire building, extending 2 blocks in height, from y = -6 to y = -8. The door frame is also made of oak planks and is located at (1, -1, 0), with the door itself being a single block of dirt.

The approximate dimensions of the building are:

* Length: 5 blocks
* Width: 3 blocks
* Height: 7 blocks (from y = -1 to y = -8)

**Structured Reconstruction Information**

**Set 1: Foundation and Walls**

Structure: Foundation and Walls
Material: Cobblestone blocks, Oak planks
Number of Materials:
	+ Cobblestone blocks: 15
	+ Oak planks: 6
Dimension: 3x3 block square (foundation), 3x5 block rectangle (walls)
Position: Centered at (0, -1, 0), extending from y = -1 to y = -6
Tips: Ensure the foundation is level and the walls are aligned properly.
Description: The foundation provides a solid base for the building, while the walls provide structural support and define the building's shape.

**Set 2: Roof and Door Frame**

Structure: Roof and Door Frame
Material: Oak planks, Dirt block
Number of Materials:
	+ Oak planks: 12
	+ Dirt block: 1
Dimension: 3x5 block rectangle (roof), 1x1 block square (door frame)
Position: Extends from y = -6 to y = -8, centered at (1, -1, 0)
Tips: Ensure the roof is evenly spaced and the door frame is aligned with the entrance.
Description: The roof provides protection from the elements, while the door frame defines the entrance to the building.<|eot_id|>
