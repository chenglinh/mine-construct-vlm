### Detailed Building Description

The building is constructed using the following blocks:

*   Cobblestone
*   Glass panes

The building can be decomposed into three main components:

*   **Base**: A cube-shaped base made of cobblestone blocks, measuring 7 blocks in length, 7 blocks in width, and 5 blocks in height. It is positioned at the origin (0, 0, 0) of the coordinate system.
*   **Tower**: A tower-like structure made of glass panes, rising from the base. The tower is 3 blocks in height and 3 blocks in width. It is centered above the base, with its base aligned with the center of the base.
*   **Top**: A small, square platform made of cobblestone blocks, located at the top of the tower. It measures 1 block in length, 1 block in width, and 1 block in height. It is positioned at the top of the tower, with its center aligned with the center of the tower.
