**Detailed Building Description**

The building is constructed using a combination of stone and glass blocks. The structure can be decomposed into three main components: the foundation, the walls, and the roof.

*   **Foundation:** The foundation is a single layer of stone blocks, providing a solid base for the building. It spans the entire width of the structure, with dimensions of 10 blocks in length and 5 blocks in width. The foundation is centered at (0, -2, 0) in the xyz coordinate system.
*   **Walls:** The walls are composed of stone blocks, with a height of 5 blocks and a width of 10 blocks. They are positioned on top of the foundation, extending from the center of the structure at (0, -2, 0) to the edges of the foundation at (-5, -2, 0) and (5, -2, 0).
*   **Roof:** The roof is made up of glass blocks, with a height of 3 blocks and a width of 10 blocks. It is placed on top of the walls, spanning the entire width of the structure. The roof is centered at (0, 2, 0) in the xyz coordinate system.

**Structured Reconstruction Information**

**Structure 1: Foundation**

*   **Structure:** Foundation
*   **Material:** Stone blocks
*   **Number of Materials:** 50
*   **Dimension:** 10 blocks (length) x 5 blocks (width) x 1 block (height)
*   **Position:** Centered at (0, -2, 0)
*   **Tips:** Ensure the foundation is level and evenly spaced.
*   **Description:** The foundation provides a stable base for the building.

**Structure 2: Walls**

*   **Structure:** Walls
*   **Material:** Stone blocks
*   **Number of Materials:** 100
*   **Dimension:** 10 blocks (width) x 5 blocks (height)
*   **Position:** Positioned on top of the foundation, extending from (-5, -2, 0) to (5, -2, 0)
*   **Tips:** Align the walls with the foundation and ensure they are evenly spaced.
*   **Description:** The walls provide structural support and define the shape of the building.

**Structure 3: Roof**

*   **Structure:** Roof
*   **Material:** Glass blocks
*   **Number of Materials:** 30
*   **Dimension:** 10 blocks (width) x 3 blocks (height)
*   **Position:** Positioned on top of the walls, centered at (0, 2, 0)
*   **Tips:** Ensure the roof is level and evenly spaced.
*   **Description:** The roof adds a decorative touch to the building and provides additional protection from the elements.<|eot_id|>
