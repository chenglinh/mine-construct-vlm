Detailed Building Description
==========================

The building is a small, one-story structure with a unique design. It features a combination of blocks, including:

*   **Brown Stone Bricks**: Used for the exterior walls and foundation.
*   **White Stone Bricks**: Used for the upper section of the walls and the roof.
*   **Glass Panes**: Used for the windows.
*   **Oak Planks**: Used for the door frame.
*   **Cobblestone**: Used for the door.

The building can be decomposed into three main components:

*   **Foundation**: A square base made of brown stone bricks, spanning 4 blocks wide and 4 blocks deep.
*   **Walls**: Two walls, each 2 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall, made of brown stone bricks. They are connected by a door made of oak planks and cobblestone.
*   **Roof**: A triangular roof made of white stone bricks, covering the top of the walls.

Approximate dimensions and positions using the xyz coordinate system:

*   **Foundation**: Centered at (0, 0, 0), spanning 4 blocks wide and 4 blocks deep.
*   **Walls**: Located 1 block above the foundation, centered at (2, 1, 2) and (2, 1, -2).
*   **Roof**: Located 1 block above the walls, spanning 2 blocks wide and 2 blocks tall, centered at (2, 2, 2) and (2, 2, -2).
