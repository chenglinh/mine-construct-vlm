**Detailed Building Description**

The building is constructed using the following blocks:

*   Cobblestone
*   Oak planks
*   Stone
*   Glass panes

The building can be decomposed into two meaningful segments:

*   **Base**: A 3x3 square base made of cobblestone, positioned at (0, 1, 0) with a height of 1 block.
*   **Structure**: A 3x3x2 structure composed of oak planks and stone, positioned at (0, 2, 0) with a height of 2 blocks. The structure has a flat top and a small overhang on one side.

**Structured Reconstruction Information**

**Base**

*   Structure: Base
*   Material: Cobblestone
*   Number of Materials: 9 blocks
*   Dimension: 3x3x1 blocks
*   Position: (0, 1, 0)
*   Tips: Ensure the base is level and secure.
*   Description: The base provides a foundation for the structure.

**Structure**

*   Structure: Structure
*   Material: Oak planks and stone
*   Number of Materials: 27 blocks (18 oak planks and 9 stone blocks)
*   Dimension: 3x3x2 blocks
*   Position: (0, 2, 0)
*   Tips: Align the structure with the base and ensure the overhang is secure.
*   Description: The structure is the main component of the building, providing a platform for other elements.

**Roof**

*   Structure: Roof
*   Material: Glass panes
*   Number of Materials: 9 blocks
*   Dimension: 3x3 blocks
*   Position: (0, 4, 0)
*   Tips: Place the roof on top of the structure, ensuring it is centered and secure.
*   Description: The roof provides a protective covering for the structure.

**Final Assembly**

*   Structure: Final Assembly
*   Material: All components (base, structure, and roof)
*   Number of Materials: 45 blocks
*   Dimension: 3x3x4 blocks
*   Position: (0, 0, 0)
*   Tips: Ensure all components are aligned and secure.
*   Description: The final assembly is the complete building, consisting of the base, structure, and roof.<|eot_id|>
