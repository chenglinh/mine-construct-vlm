**Detailed Building Description**

The building is constructed using the following blocks:

*   **Foundation**: Cobblestone blocks
*   **Walls**: Cobblestone blocks
*   **Roof**: Cobblestone blocks

The building can be decomposed into two meaningful segments or components:

*   **Foundation and Walls**: This component consists of the foundation and walls of the building. It is constructed using cobblestone blocks and has a rectangular shape with dimensions of 5x5 blocks in the x and z directions, respectively, and 2 blocks in the y direction.
*   **Roof**: This component consists of the roof of the building. It is constructed using cobblestone blocks and has a square shape with dimensions of 5x5 blocks in the x and z directions, respectively, and 2 blocks in the y direction.

The building's position and orientation in the xyz coordinate system are as follows:

*   **Foundation and Walls**: The foundation and walls are centered at (0, 0, 0) and extend 2 blocks in the positive y direction.
*   **Roof**: The roof is centered at (0, 0, 0) and extends 2 blocks in the positive y direction.

**Structured Reconstruction Information**

**Structure 1: Foundation and Walls**

*   **Structure**: Foundation and Walls
*   **Material**: Cobblestone blocks
*   **Number of Materials**: 30 cobblestone blocks
*   **Dimension**: 5x5x2 blocks (in the x, z, and y directions, respectively)
*   **Position**: Centered at (0, 0, 0), extending 2 blocks in the positive y direction
*   **Tips**: Ensure that the foundation and walls are aligned properly to create a stable structure.
*   **Description**: The foundation and walls provide the base and support for the building, respectively.

**Structure 2: Roof**

*   **Structure**: Roof
*   **Material**: Cobblestone blocks
*   **Number of Materials**: 25 cobblestone blocks
*   **Dimension**: 5x5x2 blocks (in the x, z, and y directions, respectively)
*   **Position**: Centered at (0, 0, 0), extending 2 blocks in the positive y direction
*   **Tips**: Ensure that the roof is aligned properly with the foundation and walls to create a cohesive structure.
*   **Description**: The roof provides the top surface of the building and helps to protect it from the elements.<|eot_id|>
