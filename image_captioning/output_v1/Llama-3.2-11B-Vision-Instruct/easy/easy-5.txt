### Detailed Building Description

The building is constructed using the following blocks:

*   Cobblestone blocks for the walls
*   Oak planks for the roof
*   Glass panes for the windows

The building can be decomposed into the following components:

*   Walls: The walls are made of cobblestone blocks and are approximately 5 blocks tall and 6 blocks wide. They are positioned at x = 0, y = 4, and z = 0.
*   Roof: The roof is made of oak planks and is approximately 4 blocks wide and 3 blocks long. It is positioned at x = 0, y = 9, and z = 0.

### Structured Reconstruction Information

**Step 1: Walls**

*   Structure: Walls
*   Material: Cobblestone blocks
*   Number of Materials: 30 cobblestone blocks
*   Dimension: 5 blocks tall x 6 blocks wide
*   Position: x = 0, y = 4, z = 0
*   Tips: Ensure the walls are level and even. Use the cobblestone blocks to create a solid foundation for the building.
*   Description: The walls provide the structural support for the building and create a sense of enclosure.

**Step 2: Roof**

*   Structure: Roof
*   Material: Oak planks

*   Position: x = 0, y = 9, z = 0
*   Tips: Ensure the roof is securely attached to the walls and is even. Use the oak planks to create a sturdy and visually appealing roof.
*   Description: The roof provides protection from the elements and adds a touch of elegance to the building.

**Step 3: Windows**

*   Structure: Windows
*   Material: Glass panes
*   Number of Materials: 4 glass panes
*   Dimension: 2 blocks wide x 1 block tall
*   Position: x = 2, y = 5, z = 2
*   Tips: Ensure the windows are evenly spaced and securely attached to the walls. Use the glass panes to create a sense of transparency and openness.
*   Description: The windows allow natural light to enter the building and provide a view of the surroundings.
