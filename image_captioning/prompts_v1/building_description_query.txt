Please analyze the attached image of a Minecraft building. The image includes a random background—ignore it and focus solely on the building. Assume the following:
	1.	The coordinate system is centered at (0, 0, 0), with y pointing upward.
	2.	A Minecraft character is 2 blocks tall—use this detail to infer scale and proportions.

Your output must be fully self-contained and include:

1. Detailed Building Description
	•	Identify the types of blocks used in constructing the building.
	•	Decompose the building into one or more meaningful segments or components. Note: Not every building must have components such as foundation, walls, roof, or entryway. If the building only consists of a single element (e.g., a brick wall or stone platform), simply describe that component.
	•	Provide approximate dimensions (in block units) and positions using the xyz coordinate system.
	•	Do not include typical ground materials (e.g., grass blocks or dirt) as part of the construction since they belong to the background.

2. Structured Reconstruction Information
	•	Provide multiple sets of structured information—one set per distinct structure or reconstruction step—using the following format:
	Structure Information:
		- Structure: <Name or description of the structure/component>
		- Material: <List of Minecraft materials required>
		- Number of Materials: <For each material, the number of blocks required>
		- Dimension: <Dimensions (in blocks) relative to the xyz coordinate system>
		- Position: <Starting position and spatial extent within the coordinate system>
		- Tips: <Helpful hints for placement or alignment>
		- Description: <Brief summary of the component’s purpose or design>
	•	Ensure that each set is detailed enough so that someone can accurately reconstruct the building without seeing the original image.

Do not include any information about the background. The output should serve as a complete, self-contained guide for reconstructing the Minecraft building.
