Please analyze the attached image of a Minecraft building. The image includes a random background—ignore the background and focus solely on the building. Assume the following:
	1.	The coordinate system is centered at (0, 0, 0) with y pointing upward.
	2.	A Minecraft character is 2 blocks tall—use this detail to infer scale and proportions.

Your output must be fully self-contained and include:

    1. Detailed Building Description
        •	Identify the exact types of blocks used in constructing the building. Use the official names from the following list of common building materials:
        •	stone
        •	cobblestone
        •	oak_planks
        •	spruce_planks
        •	birch_planks
        •	brick_block
        •	stone_bricks
        •	sandstone
        •	red_sandstone
        •	nether_bricks
        •	quartz_block
        •	glass_pane
        •	Decompose the building into one or more meaningful segments or components. Note: Not every building must have distinct segments such as foundation, walls, roof, or entryway; if the building only consists of a single element (e.g., a brick wall or stone platform), describe that element.
        •	Provide approximate dimensions (in block units) and positions using the xyz coordinate system.
        •	Do not include typical ground materials (e.g., grass blocks or dirt) as part of the construction.

    2. Structured Reconstruction Information
        •	Provide multiple sets of structured information—one set per distinct component or reconstruction step—using the following format:
        Structure Information:
            - Structure: <Name or description of the component>
            - Material: <Exact list of Minecraft materials required (from the reference list above)>
            - Number of Materials: <For each material, the number of blocks required>
            - Dimension: <Dimensions (in blocks) relative to the xyz coordinate system>
            - Position: <Starting position and spatial extent (adjusted relative to the previous structure's final state)>
            - Tips: <Helpful hints for placement or alignment>
            - Description: <Brief summary of the component’s purpose or design>
        •	Ensure that each set is detailed enough for someone to accurately reconstruct the building without seeing the image.
	    •	Remember that the starting position for a new step must logically follow the previous built component (for example, a layer built on top of another should start at the top of the previous layer).

If you are unable to directly access additional Minecraft IDS information online, rely on the provided list to reference the exact material names.

Do not include any information about the background. The output should serve as a complete, self-contained guide for reconstructing the Minecraft building.
